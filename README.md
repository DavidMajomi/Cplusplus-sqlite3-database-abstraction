# Why does this exist <br>
- I was working on multiple projects that require a simple database, so why not work on an abstraction that can work on multiple projects. <br>

# When to use <br>
- You are a beginner in cplusplus who just wants something that works without concern for efficiency or build systems. <br>
- You you want a simple library that works while still in the ideation stage before you build or use something else more comprehensive / suitable for the project. <br>
